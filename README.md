# Mole_Shooter
Shoot the mole. A game made in C# from a youtube video. I modified some graphics.

Important Note Regarding Flickering: Remember to enable double buffering under the 'Design' section of the main forms properties panel. This will help to prevent image flicker. Sorry for not bringing it up in the videos :(

Please subscribe to the guy that really made the original game:
